It was a good first day getting everything setup and organized into types of functions. The functionality that was built today includes:
- Searching for a player by name
- Getting basic team data
- Getting the schedule for any team
- Saving and loading your roster from a list of names
- Getting the schedule for your roster
- Listing the amount of games you have on an individual day of the week for the current week
  - e.g., monday: 7, tuesday: 1, (meaning 7 players will be active on monday and 1 will be active on tuesday)
